# Gmod-error-replacement
The files needed to replace the errors in gmod! You need to have this addon for this to work: 

# How to install
Download this repository as a zip and copy the folder named "garrysmod" to the folder your "gmod.exe" is in! Thats all you need to do!

# What does this contain
This basically replaces parts of the error handeler with custom code allowing you to disable the error messages or modify them! Please get my addon to do so.

# But I pirated my gmod and cant use the workshop :(
No worries I got you covered! Here are the cvars you can use to use this anyways!

"cl_errorenable" Can be either 1 or 0. This toggels error messages on and off. Default: 1

"cl_fullerror" Can be either 1 or 0. This toggles the replacement of all flashing error messages. Default: 0

"cl_cl_errorstext" Can be a string. This sets the error text. Default: Something is creating script errors.
# only use the following if you know what you are doing!
"cl_errorsicon" Can be a string. This sets the error icon. THIS CAN CRASH YOUR GAME IF YOU DO IT WRONG! Default: icon16/error.png
